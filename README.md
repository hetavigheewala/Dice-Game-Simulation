# Dice-Game-Simulation

This C++ program simulates a dice game where a player bets on the outcome of rolling two dice. The user enters a bet, and the program generates random dice values. Based on the dice values, the program determines whether the player wins, the house wins, or there is no winner. The game logic considers various outcomes, including sums of dice, pairs, and specific numbers, to determine the winner. The program keeps track of game statistics, including the number of games played, player wins, player winnings, house wins, and house winnings. A report displaying the game statistics is printed at the end of each session. The program can be replayed multiple times, and the user's input is validated for correctness.
